# University of Pong
Here's some ping pong code I wrote during a lecture on events.

[Try it.](http://portsoc.github.io/uniofpong/index.raw.html)

I've cleaned it up _a bit_ since (lots more to do) and added a multi-touch capability so it can be played against an opponent on a tablet.

## Challenge 1

There is a mouse controller too, but this can only really control one bat at a time, so implement `controller/keyboard.js` so that it can be played two player on a desktop machine.

## Challenge 2

Implement `controller/cpu_player.js` so that it can be played against a machine.

## Challenge 3

Improve the touch interface so that the touched y-position exactly matches the position of the bat.
